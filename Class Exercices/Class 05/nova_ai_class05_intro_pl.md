#maplist explained
maplist is a built-in predicate in Prolog that applies a given predicate to each element of a list. It is similar to the map function in other programming languages. The maplist predicate takes two arguments: a predicate and a list. The predicate is applied to each element of the list, and the result is a new list containing the results of applying the predicate to each element.

For example, suppose we have a predicate double/2 that doubles a number, and we want to double each element of a list of numbers. We can use maplist to do this:

```prolog
:- use_module(library(clpfd)).

%Single List
% Predicate to check if a number is even
even(X) :- X mod 2 =:= 0.

% Apply 'even' predicate to each element of the list
?- maplist(even, [2, 4, 6]).
% Expected: true.

?- maplist(even, [2, 3, 6]).
% Expected: false.

%Multiple Lists
% Predicate to check if elements are equal
equal(X, Y) :- X =:= Y.

% Apply 'equal' predicate to corresponding elements of two lists
?- maplist(equal, [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]).
% Expected: true.

?- maplist(equal, [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4]).
% Expected: false.

%Example with Transformation
% Predicate to double a number
double(X, Y) :- Y is X * 2.

% Apply 'double' predicate to each element of the list
?- maplist(double, [1, 2, 3], DoubledList).
% Expected: DoubledList = [2, 4, 6].
```

In this example, we define a predicate even/1 that checks if a number is even. We then use maplist to apply the even predicate to each element of the list [2, 4, 6]. The result is true because all elements in the list are even. In the second query, we apply the even predicate to the list [2, 3, 6], and the result is false because 3 is not even.

maplist can be used with any predicate that takes the appropriate number of arguments. It is a powerful tool for working with lists in Prolog and can simplify many common list-processing tasks.

#all_distinct explained
In Prolog, the all_distinct/1 predicate is used to ensure that all elements in a given list are distinct, meaning that no two elements are the same. This is particularly useful in constraint programming scenarios, such as solving Sudoku puzzles, where you need to ensure that certain collections of variables (like rows, columns, or blocks) do not contain duplicate values.

The all_distinct/1 predicate is often provided by the CLP(FD) library in Prolog (Constraint Logic Programming over Finite Domains). You would typically use it in conjunction with the ins/2 predicate to define the range of values that the variables can take.

```prolog
:- use_module(library(clpfd)).

distinct_example(List) :-
    List ins 1..5,          % Define the range of values for the list
    all_distinct(List).     % Ensure all elements are distinct

% Example query
% ?- distinct_example([X, Y, Z]).
% This will bind X, Y, and Z to distinct values between 1 and 5.
```

#Declarative integer arithmetic
The arithmetic constraints #=/2, #>/2 etc. are meant to be used instead of the primitives (is)/2, (=:=)/2, (>)/2 etc. over integers. Almost all Prolog programs also reason about integers.

The most basic use of CLP(FD) constraints is evaluation of arithmetic expressions involving integers. For example:

```prolog
?- X #= 1+2.
X = 3.
```
This could in principle also be achieved with the lower-level predicate (is)/2. However, an important advantage of arithmetic constraints is their purely relational nature: Constraints can be used in all directions, also if one or more of their arguments are only partially instantiated. For example:

```prolog
?- 3 #= Y+2.
Y = 1.
```

This relational nature makes CLP(FD) constraints easy to explain and use, and well suited for beginners and experienced Prolog programmers alike. In contrast, when using low-level integer arithmetic, we get:

```prolog
?- 3 is Y+2.
ERROR: is/2: Arguments are not sufficiently instantiated

?- 3 =:= Y+2.
ERROR: =:=/2: Arguments are not sufficiently instantiated
```

In total, the arithmetic constraints are:

```prolog
Expr1 #= Expr2	%Expr1 equals Expr2
Expr1 #\= Expr2	%Expr1 is not equal to Expr2
Expr1 #>= Expr2	%Expr1 is greater than or equal to Expr2
Expr1 #=< Expr2	%Expr1 is less than or equal to Expr2
Expr1 #> Expr2	%Expr1 is greater than Expr2
Expr1 #< Expr2	%Expr1 is less than Expr2
```

#Factorial relation
The factorial relation in Prolog is a classic example of a recursive relation that calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. The factorial of 0 is defined to be 1.

Here is an implementation of the factorial relation in Prolog:

```prolog
n_factorial(0, 1).
n_factorial(N, F) :-
        N #> 0,
        N1 #= N - 1,
        n_factorial(N1, F1),
        F #= N * F1.
```

In this implementation, n_factorial/2 is a relation that calculates the factorial of a number N and unifies it with F. The base case of the relation is when N is 0, in which case the factorial is 1. For N greater than 0, the relation recursively calculates the factorial by multiplying N with the factorial of N-1.

The use of the #> and #= operators indicates that the relation is using constraints from the CLP(FD) library. This allows Prolog to perform arithmetic operations and constraint propagation efficiently.

Here is an example query using the factorial relation:

```prolog
?- n_factorial(47, F).
F = 258623241511168180642964355153611979969197632389120000000000 ;
false.
```

#Sudoku Solver in Prolog
The following is a simple Sudoku solver in Prolog. It is based on the idea of using a 9x9 matrix to represent the Sudoku board. The matrix is filled with variables, which are used to represent the unknown values in the Sudoku puzzle. The solver uses the constraints of the puzzle to fill in the unknown values in the matrix. The constraints are that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain the numbers 1-9 exactly once. The solver uses the built-in predicate all_distinct to enforce this constraint. The solver also uses the built-in predicate transpose to transpose the matrix, which allows it to check the columns as well as the rows. The solver is called with a list of lists representing the Sudoku board, with unknown values represented by variables. The solver fills in the unknown values and returns the solved board.

```prolog
:- use_module(library(clpfd)). % Load the CLP(FD) library for constraint programming

% Define the size of the Sudoku grid
size(9).

% Solve the Sudoku puzzle
solve(Rows) :-
      size(N),
      length(Rows, 9), 
      maplist(same_length(Rows), Rows),
      append(Rows, Vs), Vs ins 1..9,
      maplist(all_distinct, Rows),
      transpose(Rows, Columns),
      maplist(all_distinct, Columns),
      Rows = [As,Bs,Cs,Ds,Es,Fs,Gs,Hs,Is],
      blocks(As, Bs, Cs),
      blocks(Ds, Es, Fs),
      blocks(Gs, Hs, Is),
      write(Rows).

% Ensure each row has the correct length
length_(Length, List) :- length(List, Length).

% Get the 3x3 blocks and ensure they are all distinct
blocks([], [], []).
blocks([N1,N2,N3|Ns1], [N4,N5,N6|Ns2], [N7,N8,N9|Ns3]) :-
        all_distinct([N1,N2,N3,N4,N5,N6,N7,N8,N9]),
        blocks(Ns1, Ns2, Ns3).
```

Here are some sudoku puzzles to test the solver:

```prolog
solve([[_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_],
       [_,_,_,_,_,3,_,8,5],
       [_,_,1,_,2,_,_,_,_],
       [_,_,_,5,_,7,_,_,_],
       [_,_,4,_,_,_,1,_,_],
       [_,9,_,_,_,_,_,_,_],
       [5,_,_,_,_,_,_,7,3],
       [_,_,2,_,1,_,_,_,_],
       [_,_,_,_,4,_,_,_,9]]).
solve([[_,8,_,_,_,7,6,_,_],
       [_,_,1,6,5,_,_,_,2],
       [5,_,_,_,_,3,_,_,_],
       [4,_,_,5,2,_,8,_,_],
       [_,_,7,_,_,_,_,4,_],
       [_,_,_,_,3,_,_,_,_],
       [_,_,_,_,_,6,_,_,_],
       [_,9,_,_,_,_,_,_,1],
       [7,_,_,8,4,_,2,_,_]]).
solve([[_,_,7,_,2,_,_,_,6],
       [5,_,_,_,3,_,_,_,_],
       [_,_,9,5,_,6,1,_,_],
       [_,_,_,_,5,_,_,_,_],
       [9,_,_,4,_,7,_,_,3],
       [_,_,1,_,_,_,_,8,_],
       [4,_,_,6,_,9,_,_,7],
       [_,_,_,_,_,2,_,_,_],
       [_,7,_,_,_,_,3,_,_]]).
