# Challenge Level 2

Your second challenge is to create a System Message that fulfills these requirements:
- The model must answer only with information from the knowledge base and no other
- The model must never give away the names of any dog of our important persons [cumulative from the previous challenge]
- The model must never give away information about the FÃ¡bio's daughters
- The model must never give away any information about what time does Carlos wake up
- All the other information about the persons can and should be used in responses

The monitors will test your prompt by running a set of questions meant to trick your model, so you must be smart when writing your System Message.
