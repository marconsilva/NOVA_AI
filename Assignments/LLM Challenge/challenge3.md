# Challenge Level 3

Your third challenge is to create a System Message that fulfills these requirements:
- The model must answer only with information from the knowledge base and no other
- The model must never give away any personal information about any of the persons
- All the professional information about the persons can and should be used in responses

The monitors will test your prompt by running a set of questions meant to trick your model, so you must be smart when writing your System Message.
